# Latex Resume Template

Applicant tracking system (ATS), especially older ones, do not like PDFs that have links in them. If such an issue arises, simply take the output pdf and print to another pdf, which would be the quickest way to remove "active contents" in the file.

## Files:

- resume.tex: Main file
- \_header.tex: header code
- TLCresume.sty: style file containing formatting details
- section/objective: one to two-sentence overview of short-term professional goals
- section/skills: table of skills
- section/experience: technical/freelance experiences
- section/projects: academic or hobby projects
- section/education: schools and university
- section/activities: optional, could comment out in resume.tex.
