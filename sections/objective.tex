I am Pranay, a third-year IT undergrad from Kolkata - India. Currently, I am pursuing my career as a \textbf{Full Stack Web Developer} with \textbf{2+ years} of professional and freelance experience. I build interactive and functional products for the web using various technologies including React, Next.js, Node.js and Strapi. \textbf{Software Engineering} for me is as much about people as it is about technology which is why I also identify myself as an \textbf{Open-Source Advocate}.
